Thus, it has the meaning of "before" in the sense of "place," as it does in the same phrase in verse 10, where it is appropriately translated in the Authorized Version as "from before Him."

Furthermore, by the resurrection of our Redeemer on that day, who opened for us the gateway to eternal life, our existence was summoned from darkness into light; hence, the Apostles wished to designate it as 'the Lord's Day.' We also find in the Sacred Scriptures that this day was revered because it marked the commencement of the world's creation, and the Holy Ghost was bestowed upon the Apostles on that day." The papacy's declaration that the Roman Catholic Church altered the observance of the Sabbath from the seventh day, as stipulated in the Decalogue, to the first day of the week, which it mistakenly refers to as "the Lord's day" (see commentary on Revelation 1:10), is a significant matter.
